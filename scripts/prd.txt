# Overview
Bible Connect is a unique productivity and spiritual growth application that encourages users to engage with physical Scripture before accessing potentially distracting digital content. Using AI-powered camera verification, the app confirms real Bible interaction before unlocking selected applications, helping users prioritize spiritual discipline in their daily routine.

Bible Connect blocks access to distracting apps until users physically touch their Bible. The app uses AI-powered camera scanning to confirm Bible interaction, then unlocks selected apps until the next day.

Our vision is to transform the relationship between digital consumption and spiritual discipline by creating a seamless bridge between physical Scripture and digital device usage.
