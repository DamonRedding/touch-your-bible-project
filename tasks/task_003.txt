# Task ID: 3
# Title: Develop Camera Integration with Google Cloud Vision API
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement camera functionality and integrate with Google Cloud Vision API for Bible text recognition
# Details:
Implement camera access using Expo Camera module. Create a camera view component with proper permissions handling and user guidance for Bible scanning. Set up Google Cloud Vision API integration for OCR text recognition. Implement text extraction logic to identify Bible text patterns and formats. Create verification algorithm that hashes recognized text for privacy while confirming Bible format. Develop error handling for poor lighting conditions or unrecognized text. Implement manual entry fallback after 3 failed attempts. Optimize the verification process to complete within 5 seconds. Add clear visual feedback during and after scanning.

# Test Strategy:
Test camera functionality on multiple devices. Verify text recognition accuracy with various Bible formats in different lighting conditions (aim for 95% accuracy). Measure verification speed to ensure it meets the 5-second target. Test error scenarios and fallback mechanisms. Verify no images or content are stored during the verification process.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up Expo Camera Module with Permissions Handling [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement the camera access functionality using Expo Camera module and handle all necessary permissions
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Install Expo Camera module and dependencies: `expo install expo-camera`
2. Create a CameraView component that wraps the Expo Camera component
3. Implement permission request logic for camera access using `expo-permissions`
4. Add UI elements for permission states (requesting, denied, granted)
5. Create intuitive UI guidance for users on how to position the Bible text
6. Implement camera controls (flash toggle, capture button)
7. Add visual guides/frame to help users position Bible text correctly

Testing approach:
- Test permission flows on both iOS and Android
- Verify camera preview displays correctly
- Test edge cases like permission denial and re-requesting permissions

## 2. Configure Google Cloud Vision API Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Set up Google Cloud Vision API credentials and implement the API client for OCR text recognition
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Create a Google Cloud project and enable the Vision API
2. Generate and securely store API credentials
3. Implement a secure API client service using environment variables for keys
4. Create a wrapper function for making OCR requests to the Vision API
5. Implement image preprocessing to optimize for text recognition (resizing, compression)
6. Add proper error handling for API failures and rate limiting
7. Create a test harness to verify API connectivity and response parsing

Testing approach:
- Test API connectivity with sample Bible text images
- Verify proper error handling with invalid credentials
- Measure and optimize request/response times
- Ensure secure credential handling

## 3. Develop Bible Text Recognition and Extraction Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.2
### Description: Implement algorithms to process OCR results and extract Bible text with verse identification
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Create pattern recognition functions to identify Bible text formats (book, chapter, verse)
2. Implement text cleaning and normalization for OCR results
3. Develop regex patterns to extract Bible references from recognized text
4. Create a verification function that confirms text matches Bible format
5. Implement a hashing mechanism for privacy-preserving text verification
6. Add logging for recognition accuracy metrics
7. Optimize text extraction for speed and accuracy

Testing approach:
- Test with various Bible formats and translations
- Verify recognition of different verse notation styles
- Test edge cases like partial text visibility
- Benchmark recognition accuracy against a test dataset

## 4. Implement Visual Feedback and Error Handling [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1, 3.3
### Description: Create a comprehensive UI feedback system for the scanning process with error handling for various failure scenarios
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Design and implement loading indicators during API processing
2. Create visual success/failure feedback animations
3. Implement error detection for common issues (poor lighting, blurry text, etc.)
4. Add specific guidance messages for different error types
5. Implement retry logic with helpful tips for improving scan quality
6. Create a counter for failed attempts
7. Add analytics tracking for success/failure rates
8. Optimize the UI to provide feedback within 5 seconds of scanning

Testing approach:
- Test feedback under various lighting conditions
- Verify error messages are clear and actionable
- Time the complete feedback cycle to ensure it meets performance requirements
- Test with users to ensure guidance is helpful

## 5. Develop Manual Entry Fallback Mechanism [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.4
### Description: Create a fallback system that allows manual text entry after multiple failed scanning attempts
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Implement a counter to track failed scanning attempts
2. Create a trigger to show manual entry after 3 failed attempts
3. Design and implement a user-friendly manual entry form
4. Add validation for manually entered Bible references
5. Implement auto-suggestions for book names during manual entry
6. Create smooth transitions between scanning and manual modes
7. Preserve user input across mode switches
8. Add analytics to track fallback usage

Testing approach:
- Verify fallback triggers correctly after 3 failures
- Test manual entry validation logic
- Test auto-suggestions accuracy
- Ensure entered data is processed the same way as scanned data
