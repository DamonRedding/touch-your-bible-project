# Task ID: 9
# Title: Optimize Performance and Battery Usage
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Optimize the application for performance, memory usage, and battery efficiency
# Details:
Profile and optimize camera verification process to complete within 5 seconds. Implement efficient background processes for app blocking to minimize battery drain. Optimize memory usage to stay under 200MB limit. Reduce app binary size to under 30MB. Implement lazy loading for non-critical components. Add performance monitoring for key user interactions. Optimize image processing during verification. Implement proper resource cleanup for camera and other system resources. Add battery usage transparency to settings. Create offline functionality for core verification features.

# Test Strategy:
Measure verification time across multiple devices to ensure 5-second target. Monitor memory usage during extended app use to verify it stays under 200MB. Check app binary size after build optimization. Measure battery impact during typical usage patterns. Test offline functionality by disabling network connection. Verify performance on lower-end devices within the supported OS versions.
