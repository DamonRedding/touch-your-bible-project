# Task ID: 4
# Title: Create App Blocking Mechanism
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the core app blocking functionality that restricts access to selected applications until Bible verification
# Details:
Research and implement platform-specific APIs for app blocking on iOS and Android. Create app selection interface with search functionality and categorization. Implement data model for storing user-selected blocked apps in Firestore. Develop blocking mechanism with 98% reliability that prevents access to selected apps until verification. Create daily reset functionality (default at 4AM, but configurable). Implement beginner discipline level logic that requires single Bible page scan. Add emergency override option for critical situations. Ensure blocking mechanism is battery-efficient by optimizing background processes.

# Test Strategy:
Test app blocking functionality on both iOS and Android with various apps. Verify reliability by attempting to access blocked apps in different scenarios. Test daily reset functionality by changing device time. Measure battery impact during extended use. Test emergency override functionality. Verify app selection interface works correctly with different app categories.
