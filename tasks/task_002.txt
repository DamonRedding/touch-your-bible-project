# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement Firebase Authentication and Data Management
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Integrate Firebase for user authentication, profile management, and secure data storage
# Details:
Set up Firebase SDK in the Expo project. Create authentication screens (sign up, login, password reset). Implement authentication context using React Context API to manage auth state throughout the app. Create TypeScript interfaces for user profile data model. Integrate Firestore for data persistence and real-time updates. Implement basic profile settings screen with ability to update user information. Set up proper error handling for authentication failures with user-friendly error messages.

# Test Strategy:
Test complete authentication flow from signup to login to logout. Verify data persistence and real-time updates using Firestore. Test error scenarios like invalid credentials or network failures. Ensure proper type safety with TypeScript interfaces. Manually verify profile information updates correctly.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up Firebase SDK and implement authentication screens [in-progress]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Install and configure the Firebase SDK in the Expo project and create the necessary authentication screens for user sign up, login, and password reset.
### Details:
1. Install Firebase SDK: `npx expo install @react-native-firebase/app @react-native-firebase/auth firebase` and required dependencies.
2. Create a Firebase project in the Firebase Console and obtain configuration.
3. Set up environment variables for Firebase config.
4. Initialize Firebase in the app entry point.
5. Implement a SignUpScreen component with email/password and optional social login options.
6. Implement a SignInScreen component with login form and 'forgot password' link.
7. Implement a PasswordResetScreen component with email input and reset functionality.
8. Add basic styling and error handling to all authentication screens.
9. Test each screen's functionality manually.
10. Ensure proper validation and error messages appear for invalid inputs.

## 2. Create authentication context and Firestore integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Implement a React Context API for managing authentication state throughout the app and integrate Firestore for data persistence.
### Details:
1. Create TypeScript interfaces for the user profile data model (UserProfile, UserPreferences, etc.).
2. Implement an AuthContext using React Context API with state for user auth status.
3. Create an AuthProvider component that wraps the app and provides authentication state and methods.
4. Implement functions in the AuthProvider: isSignedIn, signIn, signUp, signOut, and getUser.
5. Set up Firestore collections and documents structure.
6. Create utility functions for reading/writing to Firestore with proper error handling.
7. Implement automatic token refresh mechanism.
8. Add loading states for authentication operations.
9. Test the context by implementing a protected route that requires authentication.
10. Verify that auth state and data persist across app restarts.

## 3. Implement profile management functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1, 2.2
### Description: Create a profile settings screen that allows users to view and update their profile information, and implement proper error handling for all authentication-related operations.
### Details:
1. Create a ProfileScreen component to display user information from Firebase.
2. Implement form components for updating profile fields (name, email, etc.).
3. Add functionality to upload and update profile pictures using Firebase Storage.
4. Create a UserPreferencesScreen for managing app-specific settings.
5. Implement Firestore integration for saving user preferences.
6. Add comprehensive error handling for all API calls with user-friendly error messages.
7. Implement loading states and success notifications for profile update operations.
8. Create a settings menu with options for account management, preferences, and logout.
9. Add confirmation dialogs for sensitive operations like account deletion.
10. Test the complete authentication flow from signup to profile management to ensure all components work together correctly.
