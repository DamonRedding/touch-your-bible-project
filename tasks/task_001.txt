# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Project Foundation with Expo and TypeScript
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the Expo React Native project with TypeScript configuration, install core dependencies, and set up the project structure
# Details:
Create a new Expo project using the latest SDK with TypeScript template. Install essential dependencies: NativewindUI for styling, React Router for navigation, and configure ESLint/Prettier for code quality. Set up the folder structure following best practices: /src for main code, with subdirectories for /components, /screens, /hooks, /services, /types, and /utils. Configure TypeScript with strict mode. Set up Git repository with appropriate .gitignore file. Ensure the project meets the requirements for iOS 15.0+ and Android 10+ compatibility.

# Test Strategy:
Verify successful build on both iOS and Android simulators. Confirm TypeScript configuration is working properly by writing and testing a simple typed component. Ensure NativewindUI styling works correctly. Run ESLint to verify code quality rules are enforced.
