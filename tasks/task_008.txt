# Task ID: 8
# Title: Implement Discipline Level System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4, 7
# Priority: low
# Description: Develop the tiered engagement requirements system with different commitment levels
# Details:
Design and implement the discipline level data model. Create beginner level requiring single Bible page scan. Implement standard level requiring two different page scans. Develop committed level requiring three different page scans. Create UI for selecting and changing discipline levels. Implement verification logic for each level that can detect different pages. Add custom options for user-defined requirements. Create guidance and explanation for each level during selection. Ensure smooth transition when changing levels.

# Test Strategy:
Test each discipline level to verify correct verification requirements. Test page differentiation logic to ensure it can detect different Bible pages. Verify level selection UI works correctly. Test custom options configuration. Ensure changing levels mid-streak handles the transition appropriately. Test edge cases like partial completion of multi-page requirements.
