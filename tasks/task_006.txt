Test UI on multiple device sizes to ensure responsive design. Verify accessibility by testing with screen readers and different text sizes. Ensure color contrast meets accessibility guidelines. Test complete user flows from onboarding to daily usage. Verify light/dark mode switching works correctly. Test UI performance to ensure smooth animations and transitions.
