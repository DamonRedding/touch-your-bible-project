## 🚀 Pragmatic Next Actions

### **Option 1: Test Day 2 Work NOW** (15-30 min)

**Quick Validation Path**:
```bash
# Terminal 1: Dev server should already be running
# Check status:
curl http://localhost:19000

# Terminal 2: Launch iOS simulator
npm run ios

# OR: Use Expo Go on iPhone
# Scan QR code from terminal
```

**What to Test**:
1. App loads → Sign in (auth flow works)
2. Dashboard appears:
   - Greeting: "Good morning/afternoon/evening"
   - Streak card: "0 days" (stub data)
   - **Verify button**: Large, prominent, above fold
   - Stats row: 0, 0, ---
3. Tap "Verify Bible Reading":
   - Modal slides up
   - Backdrop blurs
   - Book icon (blue, 64px)
   - Headline: "Did you read your Bible today?"
4. Tap "Yes, I Read Today":
   - Console log appears ✅
   - Modal closes
   - (Day 3: Will trigger confetti + Firestore)
5. Tap "Not Yet": Modal closes

**Expected Result**: All UI works, no Firestore logic yet (Day 3)

---

### **Option 2: Jump to Day 3 Implementation** (5 hours - full day)

**Follow**: [docs/DAY_3_PLAN.md](docs/DAY_3_PLAN.md)

**Quick Start**:
```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install date-fns date-fns-tz

# 2. Create verification service
# New file: src/services/verification.ts
# Follow Day 3 plan Task 1 (2-3 hours)

# 3. Integrate into modal
# Edit: src/components/VerifyModal.tsx
# Follow Day 3 plan Task 2 (30 min)

# 4. Add confetti trigger
# Already built! Just import and trigger
# Task 3 (30 min)

# 5. Haptic feedback
# expo-haptics already installed
# Task 4 (15 min)

# 6. Loading/error states
# Task 5 (1 hour)

# 7. "Already verified" check
# Task 6 (30 min)
```

**Total Time**: 4-5 hours (all Day 3 tasks)

---

### **Option 3: Review & Document (Learning Mode)** (1-2 hours)

**Study What We Built**:
1. Read [ROUNDTABLE_DAY_2_SUMMARY.md](docs/ROUNDTABLE_DAY_2_SUMMARY.md)
2. Review [COMPONENT_CLASSNAMES.md](docs/COMPONENT_CLASSNAMES.md)
3. Study [CONFETTI_PHYSICS_TUNING.md](docs/CONFETTI_PHYSICS_TUNING.md)
4. Analyze code:
   - [DashboardScreen.tsx](src/screens/DashboardScreen.tsx)
   - [VerifyModal.tsx](src/components/VerifyModal.tsx)
   - [Confetti.tsx](src/components/Confetti.tsx)

**Learning Objectives**:
- Understand NativeWind v4 direct className approach
- See how react-native-reanimated physics work
- Learn Firestore service patterns (friends.ts, invites.ts)
- Study modal state management

## 🛠️ SuperClaude Framework Integration

### **Current Mode**: Task Management + Orchestration

**Active Modes** (from your SuperClaude config):
- ✅ **Task Management**: Complex multi-step operation (Day 2 → Day 3 → Day 14)
- ✅ **Orchestration**: Smart tool selection (Context7, Sequential, Magic MCPs)
- ✅ **Token Efficiency**: Symbol-enhanced communication (✅, ⚠️, 🚀)
- ✅ **Deep Research**: MCP-powered validation (Context7 queries)

### **MCP Tools Available for Day 3**

**Context7** (`/mcp__context7__*`):
```bash
# When to use Day 3:
- Firestore query patterns: resolve-library-id → "firebase firestore"
- Date/timezone handling: resolve-library-id → "date-fns-tz"
- Haptic feedback patterns: resolve-library-id → "expo-haptics"
```

**Sequential Thinking** (`/mcp__sequential-thinking__*`):
```bash
# When to use Day 3:
- Complex timezone logic (Hawaii vs NYC edge cases)
- Streak calculation algorithm validation
- Error handling strategy analysis
```

**Magic UI** (`/mcp__magic__*`):
```bash
# When to use Day 3+:
- Loading spinner component (if needed)
- Error message banner (Day 3 Task 5)
- Success confirmation UI
```

**Playwright** (`/mcp__playwright__*`):
```bash
# When to use Day 4+:
- End-to-end testing (verification flow)
- Screenshot capture for documentation
- Automated UI validation
```

### **Recommended SuperClaude Workflow for Day 3**

**9:00 AM - Start Day 3**:
```bash
# 1. Activate Deep Research mode for Firestore patterns
# Ask Claude: "Research Firestore timezone-aware queries using Context7"

# 2. Use Sequential Thinking for streak algorithm
# Ask Claude: "Validate streak calculation logic with Sequential MCP"

# 3. Use Magic UI for loading states (if needed)
# Ask Claude: "Generate loading spinner component with Magic MCP"
```

**Pragmatic Approach**:
- **Don't over-optimize**: Use MCPs when complexity warrants it
- **Context7 first**: Always validate with docs before implementing
- **Sequential for logic**: Complex algorithms (timezone, streaks)
- **Magic for UI**: Repetitive component work

---

## 📋 MCP Integration Checklist (Day 3)

### **Before Building Verification Service**:
- [ ] **Context7**: Query Firebase/Firestore documentation
  - `resolve-library-id → "firebase firestore web sdk"`
  - `get-library-docs → topic: "subcollections timezone serverTimestamp"`
- [ ] **Context7**: Query date-fns-tz
  - `resolve-library-id → "date-fns-tz"`
  - `get-library-docs → topic: "timezone conversion utc"`

### **During Streak Calculation Logic**:
- [ ] **Sequential**: Analyze edge cases
  - Hypothesis: User verifies at 11:59 PM
  - Validation: Does it count as correct day in all timezones?
  - Decision: Use user's local timezone, not server time

### **During UI State Management**:
- [ ] **Magic** (optional): Generate loading/error UI
  - Input: "Loading spinner with NativeWind styling"
  - Review: Validate against COMPONENT_CLASSNAMES.md
  - Edit: Adjust to match design system

### **End of Day 3 Testing**:
- [ ] **Playwright** (optional): Capture screenshots
  - Verification flow: Dashboard → Modal → Confetti
  - Save for documentation/review

## 🎓 SuperClaude Best Practices (From Session)

### **What Worked Well**:

1. **MCP Validation First** (Context7):
   - Validated NativeWind v4 before installing packages
   - Saved 2-3 hours on dependency issues
   - **Lesson**: Always query docs before coding

2. **Sequential for Complex Logic**:
   - 5-step analysis of confetti physics
   - Pragmatic decision: Keep defaults, document tuning
   - **Lesson**: Use for algorithm validation, not simple tasks

3. **Task Management Mode**:
   - TodoWrite for sprint tracking
   - Memory persistence across sessions
   - **Lesson**: Track tasks hierarchically (Plan → Phase → Task → Todo)

4. **Token Efficiency**:
   - Symbol usage (✅, ⚠️, 🚀) reduced verbosity
   - Bullet points > paragraphs
   - **Lesson**: Compressed clarity = faster iteration

### **What to Apply Day 3**:

1. **Start with MCP Validation**:
   ```
   Before: "I'll build timezone logic"
   After: "Let me validate date-fns-tz with Context7 first"
   ```

2. **Use Sequential for Algorithms**:
   ```
   Before: "I think this streak logic works"
   After: "Let me validate with Sequential MCP (5 edge cases)"
   ```

3. **Document Decisions**:
   ```
   Before: Make choice, move on
   After: Document choice + rationale + evidence (MCP output)
   ```

4. **Parallel Tool Usage**:
   ```
   Before: Sequential tool calls
   After: Multiple MCP queries in parallel (Context7 + Sequential)
   ```

## 🚦 Decision Gates for Day 3

### **Gate 1: Timezone Strategy (9:30 AM)**

**Question**: Server time or user local time for "today"?

**MCP Validation**:
- Context7: Query date-fns-tz documentation
- Sequential: Analyze Hawaii (UTC-10) vs NYC (UTC-5) edge case

**Decision Criteria**:
- User verifies 11:59 PM Hawaii → Should count as that day
- Firestore serverTimestamp → Use for ordering, not "today" check
- **Recommendation**: User's device timezone (via date-fns-tz)

---

### **Gate 2: Confetti Trigger Timing (2:00 PM)**

**Question**: Show confetti before or after Firestore write completes?

**Options**:
1. **Optimistic**: Show confetti immediately → rollback if write fails
2. **Pessimistic**: Wait for write success → show confetti (delay)

**MCP Validation**:
- Sequential: Analyze UX trade-offs (speed vs accuracy)

**Decision Criteria**:
- Jordan's UX metric: <2 seconds tap → celebration
- Marcus's reliability: Don't celebrate failures
- **Recommendation**: Optimistic (show confetti at write start, 500ms latency acceptable)

---

### **Gate 3: Error Handling Strategy (3:00 PM)**

**Question**: What errors need handling? How detailed?

**MCP Validation**:
- Context7: Query Firebase error codes
- Sequential: Prioritize error scenarios

**Error Priority**:
1. **Network offline**: "No internet connection. Try again when online."
2. **Already verified**: "✅ You already verified today!"
3. **Permission denied**: "Unable to save. Please sign in again."
4. **Unknown**: "Something went wrong. Please try again."

**Recommendation**: Cover top 3, generic catch-all for rest

## 📝 Team Handoff Notes

**From Sarah (PM)**:
> "Velocity at 166% is excellent. Day 3 timeline is realistic (4-5 hours). If confetti timing feels off during demo, we adjust then. Don't optimize prematurely."

**From Marcus (Architect)**:
> "Timezone logic is the only complexity risk Day 3. Use Context7 to validate date-fns-tz patterns before coding. I'll review the algorithm mid-day."

**From Alex (Engineer)**:
> "Confetti pre-built gives me breathing room Day 3. Focus: Firestore service quality > speed. Marcus available for timezone review."

**From Taylor (Designer)**:
> "Confetti physics constants are perfect for tuning. If Jordan reports wobble during demo, change damping: 15 (one line). Otherwise, ship it."

**From Jordan (UX)**:
> "Stopwatch test Day 3: Tap → celebration must be <2 seconds. If loading state breaks flow, we adjust. User doesn't wait for Firestore."

**From Priya (IA)**:
> "Modal simplicity maintained. Progressive disclosure works. Day 3 focus: Keep error messages clear and actionable."
