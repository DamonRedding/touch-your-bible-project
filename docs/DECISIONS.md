# Touch Your Bible - Executive Decisions

**Date**: October 7, 2025
**Sprint**: 2-Week MVP to TestFlight

---

## üéØ Critical Decisions

### 1. Platform Strategy
- **Decision**: iOS only for MVP, Android post-validation
- **Rationale**: 2-week timeline vs. 4 weeks, faster validation, reduced complexity
- **Owner**: Sarah (PM), Alex (Engineer)
- **Impact**: -50% development time

### 2. Feature Scope (MVP)

#### ‚úÖ IN (Must Ship)
1. Daily Bible verification (honor system - tap confirmation)
2. Personal streak tracking (consecutive days)
3. Points system (streak = points)
4. Global leaderboard (all users, sorted by streak)
5. Friends leaderboard (separate tab, filtered by connections)
6. Invite system (unique codes: TOUCH-XXXX)
7. Invite bonus points (+10 per friend, max 5 invites)

#### ‚ùå OUT (Post-MVP v2)
- App blocking/control features (cut entirely)
- Photo verification (OCR, camera proof)
- Private groups (church, small groups)
- Achievements/badges system
- Push notifications
- Dark mode toggle
- QR code sharing
- Admin moderation tools

### 3. Leaderboard Technology
- **Decision**: Firestore queries with 5K user cap
- **Rationale**: Simple implementation, fast to ship, migrate to Cloud Functions if scale demands
- **Owner**: Marcus (Architect), Alex (Engineer)
- **Risk Mitigation**: Growth cap prevents runaway costs

### 4. Verification Method
- **Decision**: Honor system (single tap "I read today")
- **Rationale**: Trust users, reduce friction, intrinsic motivation
- **Owner**: Jordan (UX), Alex (Engineer)
- **Future**: Optional verified badge with photo proof (v2)

### 5. Friend System Mechanics
- **Decision**: Unique invite codes + iOS share sheet
- **Rationale**: Simple, no permissions, works remotely
- **Owner**: Priya (IA), Alex (Engineer)
- **Future**: QR codes (v2)

## üöÄ Resource Optimization

### Use Off-the-Shelf
- ‚úÖ NativeWind UI (buttons, cards, lists, modals)
- ‚úÖ Expo Camera
- ‚úÖ Firebase Auth
- ‚úÖ Expo Router
- ‚úÖ React Query

### Build Custom
- Firestore schema + queries
- Streak calculation logic
- Points algorithm
- Invite code generation
